## Introduction to the US ATLAS Shared Tier 3s
US ATLAS hosts three shared Tier 3 at BNL, SLAC, and The University of Chicago (UChicago); also known as Analysis Facilities (AF). These
facilities are available to all US ATLAS physicists and computer scientists. 
<span id="introLess">...</span><span id="introMore">They are
organized and managed to support US ATLAS users' need on computing resources, including login,
run interactive and batch jobs, access ATLAS data, store private data, etc.
<br><br>
These facilities also support tools specific for users analysis, including ATLAS/CERN
software in CVMFS, Grid middleware, Rucio clients, Machine Learning packages, MPI, Jupyter
Lab with PyROOT, Xcache with auto data discovery, GPUs, etc.
<br><br>
The facilites are backed by staffs to support software environment, unix systems and
storages.</span>

## Apply computer accounts at BNL, SLAC and/or UChicago
The processes can take days at the 3 facilities, specially BNL and SLAC as both are DOE national labs. Do NOT wait until the 
last minute.

<span id="acctsLess"></span>
<span id="acctsMore">
Applying BNL computing accounts is a multiple-step process. 
[The steps are summarized at here](https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/information/getting-started/new-user-account)<br>
<br>
[Applying SLAC computing accounts](https://atlas.slac.stanford.edu/atlas-support-center)
is a two-step process: becoming a SLAC laboratory user, and then obtain computing account(s).

## SSH login to AFs, and batch jobs
BNL SSH login and batch info is available from [this page](sshlogin/ssh2BNL.md)

SLAC SSH login and batch info is available from [this page](sshlogin/ssh2SLAC.md)

UChicago SSH login and batch info is available from [this page](sshlogin/ssh2UChicago.md)

## JupyterLab at AFs
Documents, examples and entry points of the [JupyterLab at BNL and SLAC](jupyter/JupyterAtTier3s.md). 

## Data analysis tutorials 
[A tutorial of analysis example at Tier3s of BNL/SLAC is available at here](Tutorial-2019Aug).
It was initially given at the Aug. 2019 US ATLAS Week at University of Massachusetts Amherst.
